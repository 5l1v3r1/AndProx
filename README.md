# ![logo](https://github.com/AndProx/AndProx/raw/master/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png) AndProx

Prototype / work-in-progress native Android client for [Proxmark 3][1], which doesn't require root,
permission changes or other messing about with kernel modules.

This is intended to become a replacement for [Proxdroid][3] and other "root required" Android forks.

This uses the [Android USB Host API][2] and [mik3y's USB Serial for Android driver][4] in order to
access the Proxmark's USB ACM interface from user-space Java code.

**[Opt-in to the beta on Google Play][7]** | **[Direct APK download also available][6]**

## Compatibility

AndProx requires an Android device with [USB Host support][2].  This can either be provided via a
USB OTG cable, USB Type C to USB Type A adapter, or ports directly on the device.

This project targets the [mainline firmware][1], so some functionality may not be available or
broken if you use another branch.  It is suggested that you build your firmware from whatever commit
`third_party/proxmark3` points at.  Other firmwares may contain incompatible RPC messages.

This software is primarily tested on a Google Pixel Phone and Hardkernel ODroid U3.  It requires at
least Android 5.0 (API 21).

> **Note:** Some hardware, like the Nexus 4, _does not support USB Host mode_.

> **Note:** Some hardware, like Sony Android TV devices, _doesn't properly expose CDC ACM devices to
> userspace Android software_. You should absolutely not have the `cdc_acm` Linux kernel module
> loaded on your device.

## Functionality / Known Issues

- Cross compiles to `armeabi`, `armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`, `x86` and `x86_64`.  Only really tested
  on ARM.

- Many LF commands appear to work.

- LF graphs are not available yet. (Issue #1, Issue #2)

- Scripting doesn't work properly, but most of the ground work is there. (Issue #3)

- Most HF card functions don't work properly yet (likely to be a firmware issue). (Issue #4)

- `hf mf hardnested` commands use a lot of memory. In the event of running out of memory, it will
  close the application without warning.

- Anything output from `printf` won't be displayed.  `PrintAndLog` will be displayed, but will not
  be written to disk. (Issue #5)

- Flasher has not been implemented.

- Probably doesn't exit or sleep cleanly, causing high battery use. Swipe the app away from the App
  Switcher when done, and unplug the PM3.

## Getting started

1. [Install the APK][7], or [side-load the APK from GitHub][6].

2. Plug your Proxmark3 into your Android device.

3. Run AndProx, and accept the permissions bump.

4. Press "Connect"

5. Try `hw version`, `hw status` and `hw tune` to test out the device!

AndProx will write files to _Internal Storage_, in the `proxmark3` directory.

## Troubleshooting

Use the _System Info_ to show what USB devices AndProx can see.  You should see:

* USB Host: yes

  (If it says "no", your device doesn't support USB Host.)

* Found >1 USB Devices; (9ac4:4b8f; name = null)

  (If it shows 2d2d : 504d -- you have an old firmware and should upgrade.)

  (If it shows some other ID -- you may have a third-party firmware and should switch to mainline.)

  (Some devices have WiFi/Bluetooth radios connected over USB, you can ignore those.)

  (If it shows nothing, then your device isn't exposing USB devices properly, or may have the
  `cdc_acm` kernel module loaded when it shouldn't.)

* Found 1 suitable drivers; CdcAcmSerialPort

  (If it shows no suitable drivers, but the correct IDs are showing, then this is probably a
  firmware issue.)
