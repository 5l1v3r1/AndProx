# AndProx

Prototype / work-in-progress native Android client for [Proxmark 3](https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3), which doesn't require root, permission changes or other messing about.

This is intended to become a replacement for [Proxdroid](https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3/wiki/android) and other "root required" Android forks.

Source drop coming soon.
